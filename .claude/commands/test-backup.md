description: Test the backup scripts to ensure they work correctly
---

Help me test the backup scripts:

1. Check if config.sh exists and is properly configured
2. Verify the backup directories exist
3. Run a dry-run test of the backup scripts (if possible) or suggest manual testing steps
4. Check git configuration in the target directories
5. Verify logs directory exists and is writable
6. Report any issues found
