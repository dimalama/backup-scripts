description: Set up the backup scripts project with configuration
---

Help me set up the backup scripts project:

1. Check if config.sh exists, if not, guide me to create it from config.template.sh
2. Verify that all required paths are configured
3. Check if the scripts are executable
4. Verify git is available
5. Provide instructions for setting up launchd agents (if on macOS)
